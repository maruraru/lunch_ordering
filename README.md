Welcome to the lunch_ordering wiki!

App is pretty simple.
Admin creates menu for today, users make their orders (only one lunch consisting of a first course, main course and a drink). Lunches Delivery Company requests the orders for today through API. Admin also can browse days and see orders and total lunch cost of the day.

Some features you might be looking for:

* Dashboard lists last 5 days. Click on the day to open its menu. You can make lunch order only for today.

* Feel free to add new menu items, but only for today. If you added something by mistake, you can delete it.

* Auto suggest menu items. Type dish name in 'Search among recent menu items' field to find old menu items and automatically fill fields in new menu item form. You can save it to today's menu immediately or make some changes before.

* Weekly menu. Push 'Add all menu items from last [weekday]' to repeat menu of the day a week ago (in Monday you will get last Monday menu, etc). You can still change it if you need.
